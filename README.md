# Dock
Dock is a tweak that brings the iOS 11 iPad dock to older devices. This includes the floating rounded dock, as well as the floating pop-up dock above apps.

The floating dock is another SBDockView, so it should be compatible with other dock tweaks.

## Issues

1. For whatever reason, Dock depends on ClassicFolders.
2. I create an entirley new dock for the Floating Dock so you can't drag/drop apps.
3. Tweak is kinda half baked.
